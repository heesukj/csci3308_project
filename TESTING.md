## Vision Statement
People use "Grocery With Me," to easily track and manage a grocery list while being connected with friends and families. 

## User Acceptance Test Plans

## Automated Test Cases

To get automated Test Cases we have to use two different frameworks.  The first framework titled Jasmine, is a popular angular framework which is used to create unit tests. You can find more info at https://jasmine.github.io/. Jasmine uses a very simple unit tests creation process and typically you describe a function, itâ€™s purpose, and your expected/unexpected result. However, Jasmine is a standalone app that creates the unit tests, but does not run them. To run the user tests created by Jasmine we need another framework titled Karma. You can find more info about Karma at http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html. After installing Karma we run the unit tests through the framework which work for our angular 2 app. Karma opens up the browser and from the specific specified browser we run the angular 2 unit tests
